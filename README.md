**ChromBERT** is a pre-trained deep learning model designed to capture the genome-wide co-association patterns of approximately one thousand transcription regulators, thereby enabling accurate representations of context-specific transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs). As a foundational model, ChromBERT can be fine-tuned to adapt to various biological contexts through transfer learning. This significantly enhances our understanding of transcription regulation and offers a powerful tool for a broad range of research and clinical applications in different biological settings.

## Installation
ChromBERT is compatible with Python versions 3.8 or higher and requires PyTorch 2.0 or above, along with FlashAttention-2. These dependencies must be installed prior to ChromBERT.

#### Installing PyTorch 
Follow the detailed instructions on [PyTorchâ€™s official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install PyTorch according to your device and CUDA version specifications.

#### Installing FlashAttention-2
Execute the following commands to install the requried packages and [FlashAttention-2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)
```shell
# install the required packages for FlashAttention-2
pip install packaging
pip install ninja

pip install flash-attn==2.4.* --no-build-isolation # FlashAttention-3 is not supported yet, please install FlashAttention-2
```

#### Installing ChromBERT
Clone the repository and install ChromBERT using the commands below:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:TongjiZhanglab/ChromBERT.git
cd ChromBERT
pip install .
chrombert_prepare_env # download required pre-trained model and annotation data files from Hugging Face to ~/.cache/chrombert/data
```

#### Verifying Installation
To verify installation, execute the following command:
```python
import chrombert
```


## Usage

For detailed information on usage, please checkout the documentations and tutorials at [chrombert.readthedocs.io](https://chrombert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Pre-trained Model Zoo

ChromBERT has been initially trained on the human Cistrome-Human-6K dataset at 1-kb resolution. Plans for further training on the mouse Cistrome-Mouse-5K dataset at the same resolution are underway. Currently available pre-trained models include:
| Model Name                | Description                                              | Download Link                                                                                     |

| Human-6K-1kb | Pre-trained on Cistrome-Human-6K dataset at 1-kb resolution | [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TongjiZhanglab/chrombert) |

Note: Models can also be downloaded via the `chrombert_prepare_env` command, as outlined in the installation section.

## Fine-tuning ChromBERT for downstream tasks
