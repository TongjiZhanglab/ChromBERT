Installation
============

For direct usage, it is recommended to utilize the Singularity image. For development purposes, installing from source is advised as below.


Installation From Source
*************************

``ChromBERT`` is compatible with Python versions 3.8 or higher and requires ``PyTorch`` version 2.0 or above, along with ``FlashAttention-2``. These dependencies must be installed prior to ``ChromBERT``.

Installing PyTorch
------------------
Follow the detailed instructions on `PyTorchâ€™s official site <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__ to install ``PyTorch`` according to your device and CUDA version specifications.

.. note::
    ChromBERT has been tested with Python 3.9+ and Torch 2.0 to 2.4 (inclusive). Compatibility with other environments is not guaranteed.

Installing FlashAttention-2
---------------------------
Execute the following commands to install the required packages and `FlashAttention-2 <https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention>`__.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Install the required packages for FlashAttention-2
    pip install packaging
    pip install ninja
    # FlashAttention-3 is not supported yet, please install FlashAttention-2
    pip install flash-attn==2.4.* --no-build-isolation

Installing ChromBERT
--------------------
Clone the repository and install ``ChromBERT`` using the commands below:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/TongjiZhanglab/ChromBERT.git
    cd ChromBERT
    pip install .
    
Installation typically takes less than five minutes.


Then download required pre-trained model and annotation data files from Hugging Face to ~/.cache/chrombert/data.

.. code-block:: shell
    
    chrombert_prepare_env

Alternatively, if you're experiencing significant connectivity issues with Hugging Face, you can try to use the ``--hf-endpoint`` option to connect to an available mirror of Hugging Face for you.

.. code-block:: shell
    
    chrombert_prepare_env --hf-endpoint <Hugging Face endpoint>

For built-in dataset preparation, it is recommended to install `bedtools <https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/installation.html>`_.

Verifying Installation
----------------------
To verify installation, execute the following python code:

.. code-block:: python

    import chrombert


Installation Using Singularity
*****************************

We provide a pre-built Singularity image available: `chrombert.sif <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePmDK6DANSq-zkRgVBTxSBnKBZk-cEzM/view?usp=sharing>`_.


After installing ``Singularity`` (or ``Apptainer``) and downloading the image (`chrombert.sif`), you can use the built-in ``python`` environment with:

.. code-block:: bash

    singularity exec --nv chrombert.sif python -c "import chrombert; print('hello chrombert!')"


You can execute other built-in commands through the image as well. For example, to download the required pre-trained models and annotation files from Hugging Face to `~/.cache/chrombert/data`, run:

.. note::
    You must execute this command to prepare the environment, as the image does not include checkpoints and additional data by default to minimize size.

.. code-block:: bash

    singularity exec --nv chrombert.sif chrombert_prepare_env

To run your own Python scripts, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    singularity exec --nv chrombert.sif python <your_script.py>

The image also includes a built-in Jupyter kernel for interactive script development via ``jupyter notebook`` or editors like ``VSCode``:

.. code-block:: bash

    singularity exec --nv chrombert.sif jupyter notebook [other parameters]

By default, Singularity mounts your home directory inside the container. If you need to mount additional directories, use the ``--bind`` parameter. Refer to the `Singularity documentation <https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/bind_paths_and_mounts.html>`_ for more details.
