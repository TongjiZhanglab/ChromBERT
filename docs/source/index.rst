Welcome to ChromBERT's documentation!
======================================

**ChromBERT** is a pre-trained deep learning model designed to learn latent representations for genome-wide co-association among approximately one thousand transcription regulators. This enables the accurate prediction and interpretation of context-specific human regulatory networks in various downstream tasks. ChromBERT aims to establish a foundational model for transcription regulatory omics through transfer learning.
